First, place the cookies in a giant, gallonn sized bag.Take a rolling pin or pan and keep crushing them until fully crushed.

The cookie crumbs must be patted down in a 9 inch/23 cm pie dish.

The softened icecream must be spread on top and smoothed out.

Drizzle the top with melted chocolate

Freeze for 4 hours, or until the icecream has fully hardened.

Bon appetit!
